# DDK_communication_protocol_simulator
Simulate UART, I2C, ... , SPI via IPC(Inter-Process Communication) technique.
* It is an idea.
* It has two processes.
<br><br/>

## Features
* The first process communicate with the second process.
* Show some details when communication.
* One be master and the other be slave.
<br><br/>

## Platforms
* windows
<br><br/>

## Languages
* C, C++, C#
<br><br/>

## Techniques
* IPC(Inter-Process Communication)
* Share memory
* Knowledge of windows.h
<br><br/>

## Methods
1. File
2. Communications file
3. Signal; also Asynchronous System Trap
4. Socket
5. Unix domain socket
6. Message queue
7. Anonymous pipe
8. Named pipe
9. Shared memory
10. Message passing
11. Memory-mapped file
<br><br/>

## All the thinking is following bellow
1. This project will be progressed someday.
